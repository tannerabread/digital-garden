# TanneraBread Digital Garden

This is a rehash of the [first digital garden](https://github.com/tannerabread/resume) I started a while back that was a complete mess.

This one also includes [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for E2E testing.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## Cypress Tests

To run in the console:

```bash
npm run cypress:run
# or
yarn cypress:run
```

To open the cypress test runner (interactive):
Note: This does not work by default in WSL on windows, there is some configuration and a virtual linux desktop needed 

```bash
npm run cypress:open
# or
yarn cypress:open
```
